# Maestrum Landing Page

This repository contains the static marketing page for **Maestrum**, a gesture-based MIDI controller for musicians and performers. The page is a single HTML file styled with Tailwind via CDN and showcases product value, features, and a waitlist call-to-action.

## What’s inside
- `index.html`: the full landing page markup, inline Tailwind config, and a small script for nav scroll styling and mobile menu toggle.



## Page highlights
- Hero with brand, 3 persona callouts, and CTA to join the waitlist.
- Feature grid describing DAW compatibility, low latency, and webcam-only control.
- Embedded YouTube demo under “Studio”.
- Pricing/waitlist section with early-access benefits.
- Responsive navigation with glassmorphism styling and mobile menu toggle.

## Notes
- Tailwind is pulled from the CDN and extended via `tailwind.config` in `index.html` for custom fonts, colors, animations, and gradients.
- JavaScript in `index.html` handles navbar styling on scroll and the mobile menu toggle; no external dependencies beyond Tailwind and the YouTube embed.
